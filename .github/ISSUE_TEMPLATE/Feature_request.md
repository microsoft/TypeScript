I attest that all of the following are true:
 [ ] This wouldn't change the behavior of existing JavaScript code
 [ ] This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions
 [ ] This isn't a runtime feature that should be handled by TC39 instead
 [ ] This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript / JavaScript code
