        üîç Please [search thoroughly in GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/search?type=Issues) or by the query `site:github.com/microsoft/TypeScript <your keywords>` in your favorite search engine before reporting a new bug as most bugs are very likely to find precedents.

        Please fill in each section completely. Thank you!

        When did you start seeing this bug occur?

        "Bugs" that have existed in TS for a long time are very likely to be FAQs; please refer to the [FAQ wiki page](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#common-bugs-that-arent-bugs).

        Please try the nightly version of TS to see if it's already been fixed. Install `typescript@next` or use the [Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ts=Nightly).

        If possible, try bisecting the issue using [every-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/every-ts#bisecting), which should narrow down the problem to a specific change.

        The Playground also supports versions of TypeScript back to TypeScript 3.3.

        Please keep and fill in the line that best applies.

        A link to a TypeScript Playground "Share" link which shows this behavior.

        This should have the same code as the code snippet below, and use whichever settings are relevant to your report.

        As a last resort, you can link to a repo, but these will be slower for us to investigate.

        Please post the relevant code sample here as well.

        This code and the Playground code should be the same, do not use separate examples.

        We can quickly address your report if:

          - The code sample is short. Nearly all TypeScript bugs can be demonstrated in 20-30 lines of code!
          - It doesn't use external libraries. These are often issues with the type definitions rather than TypeScript bugs.
          - The incorrectness of the behavior is readily apparent from reading the sample.

        Reports are slower to investigate if:

          - We have to pare too much extraneous code.
          - We have to clone a large repo and validate that the problem isn't elsewhere.
          - The sample is confusing or doesn't clearly demonstrate what's wrong.
