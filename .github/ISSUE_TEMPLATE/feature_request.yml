        üí° Did you know? TypeScript has over 2,000 open suggestions!

        üîé Please [search thoroughly in GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/search?type=Issues) or by the query `site:github.com/microsoft/TypeScript <your keywords>` in your favorite search engine before logging new feature requests as most common ideas already have a proposal in progress.

        The "Common Feature Requests" section of the FAQ lists many popular requests: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#common-feature-requests

        Please fill in each section completely. Thank you!

      description: |
        Suggestions that don't meet all these criteria are very, very unlikely to be accepted. We always recommend reviewing the TypeScript design goals before investing time writing a proposal for ideas outside the scope of the project.

        My suggestion meets the following guidelines.
      options:
        - label: This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript/JavaScript code
          required: true
        - label: This wouldn't change the runtime behavior of existing JavaScript code
          required: true
        - label: This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions
          required: true
        - label: This isn't a runtime feature (e.g. library functionality, non-ECMAScript syntax with JavaScript output, new syntax sugar for JS, etc.)
          required: true
        - label: "This isn't a request to add a new utility type: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/No-New-Utility-Types"
