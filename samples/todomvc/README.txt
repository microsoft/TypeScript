===== TypeScript Sample: Todo MVC =====

=== Overview ===

This sample shows an implementation of the Backbone.js TODO sample derived from 
https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/tree/master/examples/todos.  The following 
TypeScript integration points are highlighted:
- Backbone.js: Using TypeScript classes to create Backbone models and views
- jQuery: Using jQuery for all DOM manipulation


=== Running ===
tsc js\todos.ts
start index.html

=== Caveats ===

This sample uses local storage and will not run properly on Internet Explore if run 
from the local filesystem.  Instead, host the sample from a web server (eg. IIS).
