asOperatorContextualType.ts(2,9): error TS2352: Conversion of type '(v: number) => number' to type '(x: number) => string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'number' is not comparable to type 'string'.
