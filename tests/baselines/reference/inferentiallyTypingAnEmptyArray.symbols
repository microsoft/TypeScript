=== tests/cases/compiler/inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts ===
// April 2014, Section 4.6:
//      In the absence of a contextual type, the type of an array literal is C[], where C is the
//      Undefined type(section 3.2.6) if the array literal is empty, or the best common type of
//      the element expressions if the array literal is not empty.
//      When an array literal is contextually typed(section 4.19) by an object type containing a
//      numeric index signature of type T, each element expression is contextually typed by T and
//      the type of the array literal is the best common type of T and the types of the element
//      expressions.
//
// While the spec does not say it, an inferential type causes an empty array literal to have
// the undefined[] type. In other words, the first clause from the excerpt above applies even
// though there is a "contextual type" present. This is the intention, even though the spec
// seems to imply the contrary.
// Therefore, the following access to bar should not cause an error because we infer
// the undefined[] type.
declare function foo<T>(arr: T[]): T;
>foo : Symbol(foo, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 0, 0))
>T : Symbol(T, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 15, 21))
>arr : Symbol(arr, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 15, 24))
>T : Symbol(T, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 15, 21))
>T : Symbol(T, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 15, 21))

foo([]).bar;
>foo : Symbol(foo, Decl(inferentiallyTypingAnEmptyArray.ts, 0, 0))
