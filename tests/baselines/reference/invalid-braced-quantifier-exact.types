    PatternCharacter ::
        SourceCharacter but not SyntaxCharacter

    Although Annex B extends the definition of Term to include
    ExtendedPatternCharacter, it also introduces the InvalidBracedQuantifier
    pattern with a higher precedence. This makes the SyntaxError for such
    patterns consistent between Annex-B and non-Annex-B environments.
