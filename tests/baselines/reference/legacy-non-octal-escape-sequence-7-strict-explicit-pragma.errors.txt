      String Literals extensions disallowed in strict mode; FourToSeven 7
    info: |
      It is possible for string literals to precede a Use Strict Directive that places the enclosing
      code in strict mode, and implementations must take care to not use this extended definition of
      EscapeSequence with such literals. For example, attempting to parse the following source text
      must fail.
    
      Strict mode is entered via the explicit Use Strict Directive.
