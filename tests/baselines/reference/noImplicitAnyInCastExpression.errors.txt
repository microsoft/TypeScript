tests/cases/compiler/noImplicitAnyInCastExpression.ts(15,2): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ c: null; }' to type 'IFoo' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Property 'a' is missing in type '{ c: null; }'.
