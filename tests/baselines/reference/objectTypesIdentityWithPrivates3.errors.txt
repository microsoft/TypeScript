tests/cases/conformance/types/typeRelationships/typeAndMemberIdentity/objectTypesIdentityWithPrivates3.ts(25,1): error TS2352: Conversion of type 'C3<T2>' to type 'C4' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Property 'y' is missing in type 'C3<T2>' but required in type 'C4'.
