tests/cases/compiler/typeParametersShouldNotBeEqual.ts(4,5): error TS2322: Type 'U' is not assignable to type 'T'.
  'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'U'.
tests/cases/compiler/typeParametersShouldNotBeEqual.ts(5,5): error TS2322: Type 'Object' is not assignable to type 'T'.
  'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'Object'.
    The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
